# Managing Client-VPN Routes

Management of the VPN routes can be altered using the `routes` command or by using the `modify` command along with the yaml config file.

**Note:** The default route via subnet association cannot be modified through this command. Use the `modify` command to alter the subnet associations.

## Routes Command

```
Options:
  r, [--region=REGION]              # AWS Region
                                    # Default: ap-southeast-2
      [--verbose], [--no-verbose]   # set log level to debug
      [--cidr=CIDR]                 # cidr range
      [--subnet=SUBNET]             # the target vpc subnet to route through, if none is supplied the default subnet is used
      [--desc=DESC]                 # description of the route
      [--groups=one two three]      # override all authorised groups on thr route
      [--add-groups=one two three]  # add authorised groups to an existing route
      [--del-groups=one two three]  # remove authorised groups from an existing route
      [--delete], [--no-delete]     # delete the route from the client vpn

List, add or delete client vpn routes
```

### Add New

to add a new route run the routes command along with the `--cidr` option

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --cidr 10.151.0.0/16
```

### Delete

to delete a  route run the routes command along with the `--cidr` option of the route to delete and the delete option

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --cidr 10.151.0.0/16 --delete
```

### Manage Authorization Groups

When using federated authentication groups can be used to control access to certain routes. These can be managed on the routes by providing the `--groups [list of groups]` along with a space delimited list of groups to the `routes` command.

To add groups to a new route or to override all groups on an exiting route use the `--groups` options

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --cidr 10.151.0.0/16 --groups devs ops
```

To add groups to an existing route use the `--add-groups` options

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --cidr 10.151.0.0/16 --add-groups admin
```

To delete groups from an existing route use the `--del-groups` options

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --cidr 10.151.0.0/16 --del-groups dev
```

## Modify Command

add or modify the `routes:` key in your config yaml file

```yaml
routes:
- cidr: 10.151.0.0/16
  desc: route to dev peered vpc
  groups:
  - devs
  - ops
- cidr: 10.152.0.0/16
  desc: route to prod peered vpc
  groups:
  - ops
```

run the `modify` command and supply the yaml file to apply the changes

```sh
cfn-vpn routes [name] --params-yaml cfnvpn.[name].yaml
```
